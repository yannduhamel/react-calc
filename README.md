# React Calc

## Why?
React Calc is a personal project that I'm doing on my free time to improve my skills in both React.js and Sass.
The goal is to replicate the calculator shown in <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29/hub">this</a> Frontend Mentor challenge.

## How?
Without a premium account on this website, I don't have access to the detailed Figma model. I'm doing it with the pictures I have in the assets section and the style-guide.md file.
